# Pre-push hook for Agent Framework
#
# This hook runs before each push to ensure code quality.
# It runs a single optimized turbo command (pnpm check) that:
#   - Builds once (cached and reused by all tasks)
#   - Runs lint, typecheck, and test in parallel after build
#   - Matches the exact CI pipeline behavior
#
# Usage:
#   Normal push:                      git push
#   Skip all hooks (use sparingly):   git push --no-verify
#
# For more information, see CONTRIBUTING.md
