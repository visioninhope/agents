## Overview

Custom triggers give you complete control over how users open Inkeep modals in your React application. Instead of using pre-built components like `InkeepChatButton`, you can create your own UI elements that match your design system while maintaining full functionality.

## Quick Start

### Basic Implementation

Here's a simple example of creating a custom button to open an Inkeep chat modal:

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import {
  InkeepModalChat,
  type InkeepModalChatProps,
} from "@inkeep/cxkit-react";

function App() {
  const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);

  const modalProps: InkeepModalChatProps = {
    aiChatSettings: {
      graphUrl: "http://localhost:3003/api/chat",
      headers: {
        "x-inkeep-tenant-id": "your-tenant-id",
        "x-inkeep-project-id": "your-project-id",
        "x-inkeep-graph-id": "your-graph-id",
      },
    },
    modalSettings: {
      isOpen: isModalOpen,
      onOpenChange: setIsModalOpen,
    },
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setIsModalOpen(true)}>
        Open Inkeep Assistant
      </button>

      <InkeepModalChat {...modalProps} />
    </>
  );
}
```
