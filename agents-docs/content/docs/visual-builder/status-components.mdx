description: Configure intelligent status updates using structured components in the Visual Builder
---

The Visual Builder provides powerful tools for configuring status updates across your agent graphs. These features keep users informed during long-running operations with either generic text summaries or structured component data.

## Default Status Updates

By default, status updates provide generic text summaries of what's happening:

- "Searching for information about your query..."
- "Found 3 relevant documents, analyzing content..."
- "Preparing detailed response based on findings..."

These are generated automatically by your graph's summarizer model based on recent agent activity.

## Custom Status Components

Status components allow you to define structured data formats for your status updates instead of generic text. This enables richer, more interactive status displays in your UI.

### Creating Status Components

1. **Navigate to your Graph** in the Visual Builder
2. **Open Graph Settings** and find the "Status Updates" section
3. **Enable Status Updates** by configuring trigger conditions
4. **Add Status Components** to define structured update formats

### Example: Tool Call Status Component

Here's an example of a custom status component that provides structured information about tool executions:

```typescript
// Tool Call Summary Component
{
  type: 'tool_call_summary',
  description: 'Summary of a tool execution and its results',
  detailsSchema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      tool_name: {
        type: 'string',
        description: 'Name of the tool that was executed'
      },
      summary: {
        type: 'string', 
        description: 'Brief description of what was accomplished'
      },
      duration: {
        type: 'number',
        description: 'Execution time in milliseconds'
      }
    },
    required: ['tool_name', 'summary']
  }
}
```

With this component, instead of generic text, you get structured data like:

```json
{
  "tool_name": "search_knowledge_base",
  "summary": "Found 5 relevant articles about API authentication",
  "duration": 1250
}
```

## AI-Powered Status Generation

Status updates are generated using your graph's configured **summarizer model**, which analyzes recent agent activity and creates contextual progress messages.

### How It Works

1. **Event Tracking**: The system monitors all agent operations (tool calls, transfers, generations)
2. **Intelligent Triggering**: Updates are sent based on event count or time intervals
3. **AI Analysis**: The summarizer model analyzes recent events and conversation context
4. **Output Generation**: Creates either generic text summaries or structured component data

### Summarizer Model Settings

The summarizer model is configured in your graph's model settings:

```typescript
// Graph-level model settings
models: {
  base: { 
    model: 'anthropic/claude-4-sonnet-20250514' // Primary model
  },
  summarizer: { 
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', // Dedicated summarizer
    providerOptions: {
      temperature: 0.3, // Lower temperature for consistent summaries
      maxTokens: 1024
    }
  }
}
```

## Visual Builder Configuration

### Graph-Level Setup

1. **Select your Graph** in the Visual Builder
2. **Open Model Settings**:
   - Set base model for agent conversations
   - Configure summarizer model for status updates
   - Adjust provider options (temperature, tokens)

3. **Configure Status Updates**:
   - **Trigger Events**: Number of operations before sending update
   - **Time Interval**: Seconds between time-based updates
   - **Custom Status Updates Prompt**: Additional context for the summarizer (max 2000 characters)

### Status Updates Prompt

You can provide a custom prompt that gets appended to the base system prompt for status generation. This allows you to:

- Customize the tone and style of status messages
- Add domain-specific context
- Guide the summarizer to focus on particular aspects

```typescript
statusUpdates: {
  numEvents: 3,
  timeInSeconds: 15,
  prompt: `Focus on user-visible progress and avoid technical details. 
Keep messages encouraging and professional. 
Always mention what information is being found or processed.`
}
```

### Status Component Designer

Use the visual component designer to create structured status updates:

1. **Component Properties**: Define the data structure
2. **Schema Validation**: Ensure consistent output format  
3. **Preview Mode**: Test how components will appear
4. **Template Customization**: Style the component display

## Inheritance and Configuration

### Graph-Level Defaults

Status components, summarizer models, and status update prompts are configured at the graph level and apply to all agents in that graph.


## Best Practices

### Model Selection

- **Summarizer Model**: Faster, efficient models (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3-Haiku) work well for status generation
- **Consistency**: Use the same summarizer across related agents for consistent status updates

### Status Component Design

- **Specific Schemas**: Define precise data structures for reliable output
- **Required Fields**: Mark essential properties as required
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear component IDs and descriptions

### Custom Prompts

- **Keep it Concise**: Status update prompts are limited to 2000 characters
- **Be Specific**: Guide the model toward the type of information you want highlighted
- **User-Focused**: Emphasize user-visible progress over technical details

### Performance Optimization

- **Event Thresholds**: Balance responsiveness with API usage (3-5 events typically work well)
- **Time Intervals**: Adjust based on typical operation duration (10-30 seconds)
- **Model Efficiency**: Choose cost-effective models for high-frequency status generation
