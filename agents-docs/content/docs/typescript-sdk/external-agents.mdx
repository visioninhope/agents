External agents let you integrate agents built outside of Inkeep—using other frameworks or platforms—into your Graph. They communicate over the A2A (Agent‑to‑Agent) protocol so your Inkeep agents can delegate tasks to them as if they were native.

<Note>
  Any agent that exposes an A2A‑compatible HTTP endpoint can be integrated by providing its `baseUrl` plus headers/auth (static or dynamic).

## Creating an External Agent

Every external agent needs a unique identifier, name, description, base URL for A2A communication, and optional authentication configuration:

```typescript
import { externalAgent } from "@inkeep/agents-manage-api/builders";

const technicalSupportAgent = externalAgent({
  id: "technical-support-agent",
  name: "Technical Support Team",
  description: "External technical support specialists for complex issues",
  baseUrl: "https://api.example.com/agents/technical-support", // A2A endpoint
});
```

## External Agent Relationships

Agents can be configured to delegate tasks to external agents.

```typescript
import { agent } from "@inkeep/agents-manage-api/builders";

// Define the customer support agent with delegation capabilities
const supportAgent = agent({
  id: "support-agent",
  name: "Customer Support Agent",
  description: "Handles customer inquiries and escalates technical issues",
  prompt: `You are a customer support agent that handles general customer inquiries.`,
  canDelegateTo: () => [technicalSupportAgent],
});

// Create the customer support graph with external agent capabilities
export const supportGraph = agentGraph({
  id: "customer-support-graph",
  name: "Customer Support System",
  description: "Handles customer inquiries and escalates to technical teams when needed",
  defaultAgent: supportAgent,
  agents: () => [supportAgent, technicalSupportAgent],
});
```

## External Agent Options

Configure authentication and custom headers as needed (static values or dynamic context variables).

```typescript
const supportExternal = externalAgent({
  // Required
  name: "External Support Agent", // Human-readable agent name
  description: "External AI agent for specialized support", // Agent's purpose
  baseUrl: "https://api.example.com/agents/support", // A2A endpoint URL

  // Optional - Static or dynamic headers
  headers: {
    Authorization: "{{requestContext.Authorization}}",
  },

  // Optional - Credential Reference
  credentialReference: myCredentialReference,
});
```
