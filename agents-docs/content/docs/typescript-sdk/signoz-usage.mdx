SigNoz is a full-stack observability platform that provides distributed tracing so that you can track requests across multiple agents and services.

### Quick Start

1. **Start the Complete Stack**:

```bash
# From the root directory of the agent framework
docker compose up -d
```

This single command starts the entire observability and integration stack:

**Agent Framework Components:**

- OTEL Collector (ports 14317-14318)
- Jaeger UI (port 16686)

**SigNoz Components:**

- SigNoz UI (port 3080)
- SigNoz OTEL Collector (ports 4317-4318)
- ClickHouse Database
- Zookeeper

### Architecture

The observability setup uses a dual-routing OTEL Collector:

```
Application → OTEL Collector → Jaeger → Jaeger UI (http://localhost:16686)
                             → SigNoz → SigNoz UI (http://localhost:3080)
```

### Application Configuration

Configure your agent framework to send traces to the OTEL Collector:

```typescript
// Recommended: Use OTEL Collector for dual routing to Jaeger + SigNoz
process.env.OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:14318/v1/traces";
process.env.OTEL_SERVICE_NAME = "inkeep-agents";

// Alternative endpoints:
// OTLP HTTP: http://localhost:14318/v1/traces (default)
// OTLP gRPC: http://localhost:14317/v1/traces
// Direct to Jaeger: http://localhost:24318 (Jaeger only)
```

### Accessing the UI

Once the stack is running, access SigNoz at: **http://localhost:3080**

You can also access:

- **Jaeger UI**: http://localhost:16686

### Stopping Services

```bash
# Stop the entire stack
docker compose down
```

## Using SigNoz UI

The **Traces** page provides detailed request tracing:

#### Viewing Traces

The SigNoz traces interface provides comprehensive visibility into your agent operations:

  alt="SigNoz Traces Explorer showing inkeep-chat service traces with timestamp, service name, operation name, duration, HTTP method, and response status code columns"
  width="100%"
  style={{ borderRadius: "10px", border: "1px solid #e1e5e9" }}
/>

The traces explorer shows:

- **Timestamp**: When each span occurred
- **Service Name**: The service that generated the span (e.g., `inkeep-chat`)
- **Operation Name**: Specific operations like `ai.generateObject`, `tls.connect`, `ai.toolCall`
- **Duration**: How long each operation took (in milliseconds)
- **HTTP Method**: For HTTP operations, shows the method (POST, GET, etc.)
- **Response Status Code**: HTTP status codes (200, 404, etc.)

Key features of the traces view:

- **Filtering Options**: Use the left sidebar to filter by duration, deployment environment, service name, and more
- **Time Range Selection**: Choose from preset ranges or custom time periods
- **Multiple Views**: Switch between List View, Traces, Time Series, and Table View
- **Real-time Updates**: Traces refresh automatically to show new data

- **Trace List**: Browse all traces with filtering options
- **Trace Details**: Drill down into individual traces
- **Span Timeline**: See the execution flow across agents

#### Filtering Traces

```
# Filter by service
service_name = "inkeep-chat"

# Filter by operation
operation = "agent.generate"

# Filter by status
status = "error"

# Filter by duration
duration > 1000ms

# Filter by custom attributes
agent.id = "customer-support-agent"
```

#### Analyzing Individual Traces

When you click on a specific trace from the list, you'll see the detailed trace view with a flamegraph visualization:

<img

  alt="SigNoz Trace Details showing flamegraph visualization with span hierarchy, timing information, and detailed span attributes"
  width="100%"
  style={{ borderRadius: "10px", border: "1px solid #e1e5e9" }}
/>

**Flamegraph Visualization:**

- **Horizontal Bars**: Each bar represents a span (operation) in your trace
- **Bar Width**: Proportional to the duration of the operation
- **Color Coding**:
  - Blue bars: Successful operations
  - Red bars: Operations with errors

**Key Information Displayed:**

- **Total Spans**: Total number of operations in this trace (e.g., 122)
- **Error Spans**: Number of spans that encountered errors (e.g., 19)
- **Trace Duration**: Total time for the entire trace (e.g., 5.2 mins)
- **Timestamp**: When the trace occurred
- **Service**: The primary service (e.g., `inkeep-chat`)

**Span Details Panel (Right Side):**

- **Span Name & ID**: Operation name and unique identifier
- **Timing**: Start time and duration
- **Service & Kind**: Which service and span type (Server, Client, etc.)
- **Status**: Success/error status code
- **Attributes, Events & Links**: Additional span metadata

**How to Use This View:**

1. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Look for the widest bars in the flamegraph - these represent the longest-running operations
2. **Find Errors**: Red bars indicate operations that failed - click on them to see error details
3. **Understand Flow**: Follow the vertical hierarchy to see how operations call each other
4. **Analyze Performance**: Use the timeline to see which operations run in parallel vs. sequentially
5. **Drill Down**: Click on any span to see detailed attributes, events, and error information
