## Overview

You can set up SigNoz in two ways:

1.  **Cloud Setup**: Use SigNoz Cloud
2. **Local Setup**: Run SigNoz locally using Docker

## Option 1: SigNoz cloud setup

### Step 1: Create a SigNoz cloud project

1. Sign up at [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/teams/)
2. Create a new project or use an existing one

### Step 2: Save your SigNoz API key, ingestion key, and SigNoz URL

You'll need to collect three pieces of information from your SigNoz dashboard:

1. **API Key**: 
   - Navigate to Settings → Workspace Settings → API Keys → New Key
   - Set expiration to "No Expiry" when creating the key
   - Copy the generated API key

2. **Ingestion Key**:
   - Navigate to Settings → Workspace Settings → Ingestion
   - Copy the ingestion key

3. **SigNoz URL**:
   - Copy the URL from your browser's address bar
   - It will look like: `https://<your-organization>.signoz.cloud`

### Step 3: Configure your root `.env` file

```
# SigNoz
SIGNOZ_URL=https://<your-organization>.signoz.cloud
SIGNOZ_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443/v1/traces
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<your-ingestion-key>"
```

### Step 4: Verify cloud setup

1. Restart your development environment:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Generate some traces by interacting with your agents

3. Open your SigNoz canloud dashboard and navigate to "Traces" to see your agent traces

## Option 2: Local SigNoz setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine

### Step 1: Clone the optional services repository

Clone the Inkeep optional local development services repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inkeep/agents-optional-local-dev
cd agents-optional-local-dev
```

### Step 2: Configure SigNoz Credentials (Optional)

In the `agents-optional-local-dev` repository, you can optionally set credentials by adding these to your `.env` file:

```bash
SIGNOZ_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
SIGNOZ_ADMIN_PASSWORD="adminADMIN#1"
```

### Step 3: Start SigNoz Services

Run the following command to start SigNoz and related services:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start:
- SigNoz frontend (accessible at `http://localhost:3080`)
- SigNoz query service
- SigNoz OTEL collector
- ClickHouse database

When you visit `http://localhost:3080`, you can log in using the credentials you configured above.

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

In your **root project directory** (of my-agent-directory), update your `.env` file:

```bash
# SigNoz Configuration
SIGNOZ_URL=http://localhost:3080
SIGNOZ_API_KEY=your-signoz-api-key
```

To get your SigNoz API key:

1. Open SigNoz at `http://localhost:3080`
2. Navigate to Settings → Account Settings → API Keys
3. Create a new API key or copy an existing one

### Step 5: Verify Setup

1. Restart your Inkeep agents:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Make some requests to your agents to generate traces

3. Open SigNoz at `http://localhost:3080` and navigate to the "Traces" section to see your agent traces

For more information on how to debug traces, see the [SigNoz Usage guide](/typescript-sdk/signoz-usage).



## Additional Observability: Langfuse Integration

If you want to connect to **Langfuse** for specialized LLM observability alongside SigNoz, you'll need to use Docker and the **local method** (Option 2 above). 

👉 **See the [Langfuse Usage guide](/typescript-sdk/langfuse-usage)** for complete setup instructions with Docker.
