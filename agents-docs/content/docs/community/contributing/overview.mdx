# Contributing to the Inkeep Agent Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Agent Framework! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

# Launch the Visual Builder

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/inkeep/agents.git
cd agents
```

### Step 2: Run the setup script
For first-time setup, run:

```bash
pnpm setup-dev
```

This will:
1. Create `.env` from the template
2. Set up user-global config at `~/.inkeep/config`
4. Install dependencies
5. Initialize the database

Add API keys for the AI providers you want to use to the root `.env`. You must have at least one AI provider configured.

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xyz789
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
```

Add your SigNoz API key to enable the traces feature (optional).

```
SIGNOZ_API_KEY=sk-xxx
```

Add your Nango secret key to enable the Nango credential store (optional).

```
NANGO_SECRET_KEY=sk-xxx
```




### Step 5: Run the agent framework

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Step 6: Start building!

Open `http://localhost:3000` in the browser and start building agents.

# Push your project

A key advantage of the Inkeep agent framework is its seamless code-to-visual workflow: define your agents programmatically, push them to the visual builder, and continue developing with the intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

Follow the steps below to push your project using the [Inkeep CLI](/typescript-sdk/cli-reference).

### Step 1: Download the Inkeep CLI

```bash
pnpm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli
```

### Step 2: Push the project

```bash
cd examples
inkeep push
```

<Note>
  The project will be pushed according to the project specified in the
  `/examples/inkeep.config.ts` file, which is set to the `default` project by
  default. Feel free to change it to your own project.
</Note>

### Step 3: Observe the graph in the visual builder

<img
  src="/gifs/basic-graph.gif"
  alt="Basic graph"
  width="100%"
  style={{ borderRadius: "10px", border: "1px solid #e1e5e9" }}
/>

# Set up live traces

### Step 1: Launch docker containers

```bash
cd deploy/docker
docker compose up -d
```

### Step 2: Fetch SigNoz API Key

Open `http://localhost:3080` in the browser. Go to **Settings** → **Workspace Settings** → **API Keys** and copy the API key.

### Step 3: Configure environment variable

Create a `.env` file at `/agents-manage-ui/` with the following variable:

```
SIGNOZ_API_KEY=your-signoz-api-key-here
```

### Step 4: View your live traces

Refresh the live traces panel on the right to see your agents in action.

<img
  src="/images/live-traces.png"
  alt="Live traces showing"
  width="100%"
  style={{ borderRadius: "10px", border: "1px solid #e1e5e9" }}
/>

# Set up credentials

### Step 1: Create .env file and generate encryption key

```bash
cp deploy/docker/.env.nango.example deploy/docker/.env && encryption_key=$(openssl rand -base64 32) && sed -i '' "s|REPLACE_WITH_BASE64_256BIT_ENCRYPTION_KEY|$encryption_key|" deploy/docker/.env && echo "Docker environment file created with auto-generated encryption key"
```

### Step 2: Restart the containers

```bash
cd deploy/docker
docker compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Get your Nango API key

Open the Nango Dashboard: `http://localhost:3050` and navigate to **Environment Settings** → **API Keys** and copy the API key.

### Step 4: Configure environment variables

Navigate back to the root directory and paste the below command. Enter your Nango API key when prompted:

```bash
cd ../../
printf "Enter your Nango API key: " && read key && sed -i '' "s|^NANGO_SECRET_KEY=.*|NANGO_SECRET_KEY=$key|" agents-manage-api/.env agents-run-api/.env agents-manage-ui/.env && echo "Application files updated with Nango API key"
```

### Step 5: Start creating credentials!

Navigate to the Credentials tab in the left sidebar and click "Create credential".

# Development Workflow

### Git Hooks

This project uses Husky for Git hooks to maintain code quality. The hooks are automatically installed when you run `pnpm install`.

#### Pre-commit Hook

The pre-commit hook runs the following checks before allowing a commit:

1. **Type checking** - Ensures type safety across all packages
2. **Tests** - Runs the test suite

##### Bypassing Checks

While we recommend running all checks, there are legitimate cases where you might need to bypass them:

**Skip typecheck only (tests still run):**

```bash
SKIP_TYPECHECK=1 git commit -m "WIP: debugging issue"
```

**Skip all hooks (use sparingly):**

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency: hotfix for production"
```

> **Note:** Use these bypass mechanisms sparingly. They're intended for:
>
> - Work-in-progress commits that you'll fix before pushing
> - Emergency fixes where speed is critical
> - Commits that only touch non-code files (though hooks are smart enough to handle this)

### Code Quality

#### Type Checking

Run type checking across all packages:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

#### Linting

Run the linter:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

Format code automatically:

```bash
pnpm format
```

#### Testing

Run tests:

```bash
pnpm test              # Run all tests
pnpm test:watch        # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:coverage     # Run tests with coverage report
```

### Building

Build all packages:

```bash
pnpm build
```

# CLI Development

## Running the CLI Locally

When developing the CLI, you can run the local version directly without global installation:

```bash
# Build the CLI first
cd agents-cli
pnpm build

# Run the local CLI from the repository root
node agents-cli/dist/index.js --version

# Or use the convenience script (if available)
./scripts/inkeep-local.sh --version
```

## Testing CLI Changes

1. **Build the CLI after making changes:**
```bash
cd agents-cli
pnpm build
```

2. **Test commands locally:**
```bash
# From repository root
node agents-cli/dist/index.js push examples/agent-configurations/graph.graph.ts
node agents-cli/dist/index.js chat
```

3. **Run CLI tests:**
```bash
cd agents-cli
pnpm test
```

## Switching Between Local and Published CLI

During development, you may need to test both the local development version and the published npm package:

```bash
# Use local development version
node /path/to/agents/agents-cli/dist/index.js --version

# Use globally installed published version
inkeep --version
```

For detailed information about switching between versions, see the `INKEEP_CLI_SWITCHING.md` file in the repository root.

# Commit Messages

We follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test changes
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

# Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure all checks pass (`pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`)
5. Commit your changes (following commit message guidelines)
6. Push to your fork
7. Open a pull request

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Update tests for any behavior changes
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review

# Continuous Integration

Our CI pipeline runs on all pull requests and includes:

- Type checking (`pnpm typecheck`)
- Tests (`pnpm test`)
- Build verification (`pnpm build`)

These checks must pass before a PR can be merged. The same checks run in pre-commit hooks to catch issues early.

# Questions?

If you have questions about contributing, please:

1. Check existing issues and discussions
2. Open a new issue if your question isn't addressed
3. Reach out to the maintainers
