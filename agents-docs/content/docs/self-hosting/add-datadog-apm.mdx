## Overview

Learn how to add Datadog APM to your Inkeep Agent Framework services.

## Step 1: install Datadog APM

From the root of your workspace, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm install dd-trace
```

## Step 2: Setup tracer.ts
 
In `apps/run-api` and `apps/manage-api` create a new file called `tracer.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
import tracer from "dd-trace";
tracer.init(); // initialized in a different file to avoid hoisting.
export default tracer;
```

In `apps/run-api/src/index.ts` and `apps/manage-api/src/index.ts` add the following code to the top of the file before all other imports:

```typescript
import "./tracer";
```
