### No Authentication

When running the API server locally with `pnpm dev`, authentication is automatically bypassed. You can use headers in the request instead:

**Request Headers:**
```http
x-inkeep-tenant-id: <tenant-id>
x-inkeep-project-id: <project-id>
x-inkeep-graph-id: <graph-id>
```

<Warning>
This mode is for development only. Never use in production as it bypasses all security checks.
</Warning>

</Tab>

<Tab title="Production">

### API Key Authentication

For production, use a graph-scoped API key for secure authentication.

**Create an API Key:**
1. Open the Visual Builder Dashboard
2. Go to your Project → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create**, select the target agent graph
4. Copy the API key (it will be shown once) and store it securely

**Request Header:**
```http
Authorization: Bearer <graph_api_key>
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Advanced: Global Bypass Secret">

The global bypass secret allows internal services to authenticate without per-graph API keys.

**Server Configuration:**
```bash
INKEEP_AGENTS_RUN_API_BYPASS_SECRET=<your-secret>
```

**Request Headers:**
```http
Authorization: Bearer <bypass_secret>
x-inkeep-tenant-id: <tenant-id>
x-inkeep-project-id: <project-id>
x-inkeep-graph-id: <graph-id>
```

**Use Cases:**
- Internal services accessing multiple graphs
- Staging/testing environments
- Automation tools managing multiple graphs
